\cventry{Fall 2016}{Internet of Things in Xinu}{}{}{}%{University of Florida}{Gainesville, FL}{}
{We have integrated multiple analog sensors to a Beagle Bone Black board. Java websocket was used as the communication protocol between the edge and cloud server. Digital inputs from sensors were transferred through GPIO pins. Multiple devices like temperature sensors and BBB were mapped in DDL files. Data in/out communication was interrupt-driven. Additionally, the website support to display the current status of the sensor and also control the sensor. The project was implemented in C and Java. .}

\cventry{Fall 2015}{Micro-structure characterization}{}{}{}%{University of Florida}{Gainesville, FL}{}
{Applied filtering, rendering, boundary detection, and minimal connected component identification to electron scanned microscope graphs to quantitatively represent distributions of grain size of welding metals based on a linear interception method and grain surface area. The image included 3200 connected components.}
\cventry{Summer 2014}{Sensor network deployment}{}{}{}%{University of Florida}{Gainesville, FL}{}
{"Lightweight secure low energy adaptive clustering hierarchy (LS-LEACH): a new secure and energy efficient routing protocol for wireless sensor network". We have created and simulated a wireless sensor network. LEACH and LS-LEACH protocols were implemented and their energy efficiencies were compared. The project was composed of a proposal, a progress report, two presentations and a demo. }

\cventry{Fall 2013}{Micro-structure characterization}{}{}{}%{University of Florida}{Gainesville, FL}{}
{"Single channel numerical analysis for boiling water reactor and pressurized water reactor". We have considered maximum fuel temperature, maximum cladding temperature, minimum critical heat flux ratio, and applicable range of parameters including the mass flow rates and maximum linear heat transfer. The project was composed of a 40-page technical report and a code package.}
